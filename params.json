The next paragraph contains two phrases separated by a single newline character:\r\n\r\nRoses are red\r\nViolets are blue\r\n\r\nThe next paragraph has the same phrases, but now they are separated by two spaces and a newline character:\r\n\r\nRoses are red  \r\nViolets are blue\r\n\r\nMath is hard, let's go shopping\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn first grade I learned that 5 > 3 and 2 < 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -> 2 -> 3. 9 <- 8 <- 7.\r\n\r\nTriangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2\r\n\r\nWe all like making lists\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThe above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:\r\n\r\n* Red Apples\r\n* Purple Grapes\r\n* Green Kiwifruits\r\n\r\nLet's get crazy:\r\n\r\n1.  This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor\r\n    sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit\r\n    mi posuere lectus.\r\n\r\n    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet\r\n    vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum\r\n    sit amet velit.\r\n\r\n2.  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\r\n\r\nWhat about some code **in** a list? That's insane, right?\r\n\r\n1. In Ruby you can map like this:\r\n\r\n        ['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }\r\n\r\n2. In Rails, you can do a shortcut:\r\n\r\n        ['a', 'b'].map(&:uppercase)\r\n\r\nSome people seem to like definition lists\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n  <dt>Lower cost</dt>\r\n  <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>\r\n  <dt>Easier to use</dt>\r\n  <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\nI am a robot\r\n------------\r\n\r\nMaybe you want to print `robot` to the console 1000 times. Why not?\r\n\r\n    def robot_invasion\r\n      puts(\"robot \" * 1000)\r\n    end\r\n\r\nYou see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.\r\n\r\nHow about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"footer\">\r\n        &copy; 2004 Foo Corporation\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\nSet in stone\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPreformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:\r\n\r\n\r\n             ,-. \r\n      ,     ,-.   ,-. \r\n     / \\   (   )-(   ) \r\n     \\ |  ,.>-(   )-< \r\n      \\|,' (   )-(   ) \r\n       Y ___`-'   `-' \r\n       |/__/   `-' \r\n       | \r\n       | \r\n       |    -hrr- \r\n    ___|_____________ \r\n\r\nPlaying the blame game\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nIf you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:\r\n\r\n> I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps someone a little less eloquent:\r\n\r\n> I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I\r\n> could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in\r\n> the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to\r\n> come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...\r\n>\r\n> I don't want to sound like\r\n> I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you\r\n> just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet\r\n> as I should be in coming up with one.\r\n\r\n## Table for two\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>ID</th><th>Name</th><th>Rank</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>1</td><td>Tom Preston-Werner</td><td>Awesome</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>2</td><td>Albert Einstein</td><td>Nearly as awesome</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n### Crazy linking action\r\n\r\nI get 10 times more traffic from [Google] [1] than from\r\n[Yahoo] [2] or [MSN] [3].\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://google.com/        \"Google\"\r\n  [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  \"Yahoo Search\"\r\n  [3]: http://search.msn.com/    \"MSN Search\"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
