Terms and words
--------------------------

In this document we seek to explain all special words and abbreviations we use.


Basics
---

*Application**

Everything we work with is refered to as an application. This includes and is not limited to websites, apps, internal applications, programs and API's.


Environments

Whenever we work, we always strive to have multiple environments. With environments we mean different versions of a particular application, such as TEST, DEVELOPMENT and QA. 

**Production / Prod**

Production refers to the live version of the application. 

**Development / Dev**

Refers to a shared development version of the application, that has its own database used for testing.

**Accepted abbreviations**

General rule: do not invent abbreviations, as it will make it extremely difficult for newcomers.

ASAP: As Soon As Possible.

ATM: At The Moment.
