Description of a tester
================================

**General description**:

Everything that comes out of Jarboo, **has to work**.

The testers role is to make sure that both the expectated behavior of the task is actually working, but also trying to break the solution and find "weird things" / things that feels unfinished.

**Core tasks:**

- Make sure tasks work as they should
- Solution should not be breakable
