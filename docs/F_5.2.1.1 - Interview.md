F_5.2.1.5 - Interview
============================


Hi,

Thanks a lot for your offer! I hope we'll be the right match and build great things together and make the world a better place :-)

I want to be 100% honest about my interview process. As the people we take in usually work with us for many months (sometimes years), we do the following:

1) I am writing to max 10 different people who make an offer
2) I ask some questions on Upwork
3) The 3 best applicants get on Skype
4) I ask some more questions
5) I pick 1-2 people to work

When starting out there is a 1-2 hours training you have to go through (it's simple - I promise).

SO.

Questions.

1) Are you a freelancer or a team?
2) How many hours do you have per week?
