How and when to estimate
=======

How our estimates work
----------

Every single task we do, has to be estimated and accepted by the customer.

Our estimates work like this:

- We provide an estimate, using the "C_25.2.2 - Estimation templates"
- The customer accepts it as described in the [task lifecycle](C_25.1.1 - Task lifecycle.md)
- We're doing everything we can go deliver within the estimate

IF we get worried an estimate seems to be too low, we pause the task. We contact the customer and explains what has happened, why it is happening and what our new estimate will be.


When to estimate
----------------
Before we can estimate a task, it has to be very precise. That means we have to be able to say yes to the following:

 - Are there mockups of all views?
 - Is all the customers hidden assumptions clear?
 - Are third party integrations clear?


In general, we have to be able to fill out the Jira template for project managers, which involves a maximum hours per sub task.

How to estimate
---------------

Use the "C_25.2.2 - Estimation templates" template, which takes much more than just development hours into account.
