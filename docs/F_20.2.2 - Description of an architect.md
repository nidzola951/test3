Description of an architect
================================

**General description:**
You should receive tasks that is specced in detail, and these tasks should be turned into actual code that works. Your task is to take the task which is described, and explain **in detail** how it should be implemented (into Class, Interfaces, REST endpoints detail).

That results in these core tasks:

**Core tasks:**

- Break tasks into subtasks of maximum 5 hours
- Describe, in technical detail (very detailed), how a task should be implemented
- Make sure the overall technical architecture makes sense (not only for the given task)
