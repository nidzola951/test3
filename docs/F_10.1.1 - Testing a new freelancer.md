F_10.1.1 - Testing a new freelancer
============================

Less than half the freelancers we pick, will not be good enough. 

Because of that, we have this process to:

- Minimize the impact of bad freelancers
- Get them thrown out of the system as soon as possible

Avoid bad freelancers in the first place
---------------------

It's essential we try to avoid bad freelancers in the first place. That is done by following the prodcesses in F_5, and ensuring communication is easy.

First task should be a small one (max 8 hours)
---------------------

When we get a new freelancer, **no matter role**, the rules for starting are simple:

- Only assign to ONE task 
- This ONE task should be 8 hours or below
- Only ONE role (ie. not allowed to be both architect and developer for first task)
- Only ONE project (don't start a freelancer up on multiple projects, even project managers)

The first task should be a relatively simple task, that shows the freelancer can:

- Actually deliver results
- Deliver high quality
- Understand the project
