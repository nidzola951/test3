Temporary dummy texts
---

Whenever you write a dummy text, do not use lorem ipsum or even worse, offending texts.

ALWAYS use a text that *could* be acceptable. By doing that, if someone forget to edit it (which happens a lot), it's not a disaster. Going live with lorem ipsum, or something offensive, is.
