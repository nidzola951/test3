Different Jarboo roles
---


As described in [Read about Jarboo Development](C_15.1.3 - Jarboo Development.md) , we use the V-model for development. That leaves us with 5 different roles, inside the [task lifecycle](C_25.1.1 - Task lifecycle.md) .

Not all projects have a unique person pr role

While there might be five different rules, that does absolutely not mean a project needs five unique people.

Often a project manager will be both project manager and tester, an architect will be both architect and code reviewer and sometimes even the coder. 

It's just important we try to separete the roles, so we think of them as unique tasks and responsibilities.
