Description of a code reviewer
================================

**General description**:

Code quality is a cornerstone of Jarboo. That means all code should be reviewer by a code reviewer.

A code reviewer should review (often pull requests), and make sure the code is implemented in a proper way. Often this involves comparing with how the architect described the task.

**Core tasks:**

- Review pull requests
- Make sure code has as few bugs as possible
