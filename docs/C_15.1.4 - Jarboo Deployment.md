Jarboo Deployment
--------------------------

Jarboo Deplyoyment is a product where we are responsible for putting the code live and into production.

Whenever we move a new version of an application into production, we open a (customer paid) release window unless their contract states otherwise.


Definition of a release window
---

Whenever we decide to put code into production, we by default have a 3 hour release window.

A release window starts counting from the time of release, and then until 3 hours later. In these 3 hours we're responsible for making sure the application is running, and if customer finds any challenges, we're obligated to fix them under our normal terms and conditions.

A customer might decide to overwrite this, which will be shown on the individual customer.

If a customer have decided to skip the release window and doesn't pay for it, our normal obligations and response times apply.
